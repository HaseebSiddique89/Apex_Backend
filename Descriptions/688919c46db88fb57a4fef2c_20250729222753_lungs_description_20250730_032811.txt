1.  The image shows a pair of human lungs with the trachea and bronchi.

2.  The lungs are a pair of spongy, air-filled organs located on either side of the chest (thorax). The trachea, or windpipe, carries air into the lungs and then branches into the right and left main bronchi. These bronchi then divide into smaller and smaller bronchioles.

3.  **Structure of the Lungs:**
    *   **Trachea:** A large tube reinforced by cartilage rings to prevent collapse. It carries air to and from the lungs.
    *   **Bronchi:** The trachea divides into two main bronchi, one entering each lung. They also have cartilage rings.
    *   **Bronchioles:** These are smaller branches of the bronchi within the lungs and lack cartilage. They lead to alveoli.
    *   **Alveoli:** Tiny air sacs where gas exchange occurs. They are surrounded by capillaries.
    *   **Pleura:** A double-layered membrane surrounding each lung. The space between the layers contains pleural fluid, which reduces friction during breathing.
    *   **Lobes:** The right lung has three lobes (superior, middle, and inferior), while the left lung has two (superior and inferior) to accommodate the heart.

4.  **Main Functions:**
    *   **Gas Exchange:** The primary function is to exchange oxygen from inhaled air for carbon dioxide from the blood. This occurs in the alveoli. Oxygen diffuses from the alveoli into the blood, and carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the alveoli to be exhaled.
    *   **Respiration:** The lungs enable breathing, which is the process of moving air in and out of the body.
    *   **Acid-Base Balance:** By regulating the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood, the lungs help maintain the body's pH balance.

5.  **Additional Information:**
    *   The lungs are highly elastic, allowing them to expand and contract during breathing.
    *   The total surface area of the alveoli in both lungs is approximately 70 square meters, roughly the size of a tennis court. This large surface area facilitates efficient gas exchange.
    *   Lung diseases, such as asthma, bronchitis, emphysema, and pneumonia, can impair lung function and affect breathing and oxygen uptake. Smoking is a major risk factor for lung cancer and other respiratory illnesses.
