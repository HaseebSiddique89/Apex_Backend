2.  The human brain is the central organ of the nervous system, responsible for controlling virtually all bodily functions, thought processes, and behavior. It is a complex structure composed of various regions, each with specialized roles.

3.  The brain is divided into several major lobes:
    *   **Frontal Lobe:** Located at the front of the brain, it extends from the forehead back to the central sulcus.
    *   **Parietal Lobe:** Situated behind the frontal lobe, separated by the central sulcus.
    *   **Temporal Lobe:** Located on the sides of the brain, beneath the frontal and parietal lobes.
    *   **Occipital Lobe:** Found at the back of the brain.
    *   **Cerebellum:** Positioned at the base of the brain, beneath the occipital lobe, and behind the brainstem.
    *   **Spinal Cord:** An extension of the brainstem, connecting the brain to the rest of the body.
    *   **Central Sulcus:** A prominent groove separating the frontal and parietal lobes.

4.  Each lobe has specific functions:
    *   **Frontal Lobe:** Involved in higher cognitive functions such as planning, decision-making, working memory, speech production (Broca's area), and motor control.
    *   **Parietal Lobe:** Processes sensory information, including touch, temperature, pain, spatial awareness, and navigation.
    *   **Temporal Lobe:** Responsible for auditory processing, memory formation (hippocampus), language comprehension (Wernicke's area), and object recognition.
    *   **Occipital Lobe:** Primarily involved in visual processing.
    *   **Cerebellum:** Coordinates movement, maintains balance, and assists in motor learning.
    *   **Spinal Cord:** Relays signals between the brain and the peripheral nervous system, controlling reflexes and transmitting sensory and motor information.

5.  The brain's lobes work interdependently, not in isolation. Complex tasks require the coordinated activity of multiple brain regions. The cerebral cortex, the outer layer of the brain, is highly folded, increasing surface area for neural connections. Damage to specific areas of the brain can result in predictable functional deficits, which helps neuroscientists understand the role of each region.
