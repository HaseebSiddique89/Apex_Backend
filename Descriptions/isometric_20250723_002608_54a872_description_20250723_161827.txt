1.  The object present in the image is a human heart.

2.  The human heart is a muscular organ responsible for pumping blood throughout the body, delivering oxygen and nutrients to tissues and removing carbon dioxide and waste products. It is located in the chest cavity, between the lungs, and is approximately the size of a fist.

3.  The heart is composed of four chambers:
    *   **Atria (Right and Left):** These are the upper chambers that receive blood returning to the heart. The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the body, while the left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the lungs.
    *   **Ventricles (Right and Left):** These are the lower chambers that pump blood out of the heart. The right ventricle pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs, and the left ventricle pumps oxygenated blood to the rest of the body.
    The heart also contains valves that ensure blood flows in one direction:
    *   **Tricuspid Valve:** Located between the right atrium and right ventricle.
    *   **Pulmonary Valve:** Located between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery.
    *   **Mitral Valve (Bicuspid Valve):** Located between the left atrium and left ventricle.
    *   **Aortic Valve:** Located between the left ventricle and the aorta.
    Major blood vessels connected to the heart:
    *   **Superior and Inferior Vena Cava:** Bring deoxygenated blood from the body to the right atrium.
    *   **Pulmonary Artery:** Carries deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the lungs.
    *   **Pulmonary Veins:** Carry oxygenated blood from the lungs to the left atrium.
    *   **Aorta:** Carries oxygenated blood from the left ventricle to the body.

4.  The main functions of the heart are:
    *   **Pumping Blood:** The heart's primary function is to pump blood throughout the body. It does this by contracting and relaxing, creating pressure that forces blood through the circulatory system.
    *   **Oxygen and Nutrient Delivery:** By pumping blood, the heart ensures that oxygen and nutrients are delivered to every cell in the body.
    *   **Waste Removal:** The heart also facilitates the removal of waste products, such as carbon dioxide, from the body.
    *   **Blood Pressure Regulation:** The heart plays a crucial role in maintaining blood pressure, ensuring adequate blood flow to all organs and tissues.

5.  The heart is controlled by its own intrinsic electrical conduction system, which consists of the sinoatrial (SA) node (the heart's natural pacemaker), the atrioventricular (AV) node, and a network of specialized muscle fibers. The coronary arteries supply the heart muscle itself with blood, and any blockage in these arteries can lead to a heart attack. Heart health can be maintained through regular exercise, a balanced diet, and avoiding smoking.
