1.  The object is a human heart.
2.  The human heart is a muscular organ about the size of a fist, located in the chest between the lungs. It is the central organ of the circulatory system, responsible for pumping blood throughout the body.
3.  The heart consists of four chambers: two atria (right and left) and two ventricles (right and left). The atria are the upper chambers that receive blood, while the ventricles are the lower chambers that pump blood out of the heart. The right side of the heart handles deoxygenated blood, while the left side handles oxygenated blood. Valves (tricuspid, pulmonary, mitral, and aortic) ensure unidirectional blood flow. The heart muscle (myocardium) is supplied with blood via the coronary arteries. The sinoatrial (SA) node, often called the heart's natural pacemaker, generates electrical impulses that initiate each heartbeat. The atrioventricular (AV) node relays these impulses, allowing the atria to contract before the ventricles.
4.  The main function of the heart is to pump blood throughout the body. The right side of the heart pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs for oxygenation. The left side of the heart receives oxygenated blood from the lungs and pumps it to the rest of the body. The heart also maintains blood pressure and ensures adequate blood flow to all organs and tissues.
5.  The heart is essential for delivering oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and immune cells to tissues and removing waste products like carbon dioxide. Common heart diseases include coronary artery disease, heart failure, arrhythmias, and congenital heart defects. Heart attacks occur when blood flow to the heart muscle is blocked. The heart can beat independently of the brain because of its intrinsic electrical conduction system. The first successful human heart transplant was performed in 1967 by Dr. Christiaan Barnard. The average adult heart beats approximately 72 times per minute at rest, pumping about 5 liters of blood each minute.
